# Bluetooth_BLE
This app is used to list the BT and BLE devices separately
The app first asks for permission to enable/disable the BT 
Following this it has a button to start it's discoverability where the BT of that device will be available to other devices to be discovered
To check the BT devices by clicking onto Bluetooth Button it takes us to new activity where it lists the Paired Devices after clicking on the Pair button and on clicking onto Scan shows us devices which are currently available onto a different activity
To delete a already paired device from list click on that device and wait, allow the pop conditions and the device will be removed
We can return to Home Page of App by clicking on the Back button
On Home Page now clicking on BLE, it takes us to page where on clicking on the Scan button shows us the available BLE(BLuetooth Low Energy) devices.
Again we can return to Home Page using back button.
It takes few seconds to Scan the devices.

For android devices having version 10 and above it is required to enable the Location for the app top be able to Scan the new devices.
Allow the app to use the Location settings always.
